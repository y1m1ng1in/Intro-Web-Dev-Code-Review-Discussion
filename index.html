          <p>
            The Scottish Fold is a breed of domestic cat with a natural dominant gene mutation that
            affects cartilage throughout the body, causing the ears to "fold", bending forward and
            down towards the front of the head, which gives the cat what is often described as an
            "owl-like" appearance.

        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>
          The Scottish Fold is a breed of domestic cat with a natural dominant gene mutation that
          affects cartilage throughout the body, causing the ears to "fold", bending forward and
          down towards the front of the head, which gives the cat what is often described as an
          "owl-like" appearance.
          <br />
          <br />
          Originally called lop-eared or lops after the lop-eared rabbit, Scottish Fold became the
          breed's name in 1966. Depending on registries, longhaired Scottish Folds are varyingly
          known as Highland Fold, Scottish Fold Longhair, Longhair Fold and Coupari.
          <br />
          <br />
          All Fold cats are affected by osteochondrodysplasia (OCD), a developmental abnormality
          that affects cartilage and bone development throughout the body. This condition causes the
          ear fold in the breed and studies point to all Fold cats being affected by it. Fold cats
          therefore have malformed bone structures and can develop severe painful degenerative joint
          diseases at an early age. Due to these health conditions, breeding Fold cats is prohibited
          in several countries and some major cat registries do not recognise the cat breed.

            <p>
              The original Scottish Fold was a white barn cat named Susie, who was found at a farm
              near Coupar Angus in Perthshire, Scotland, in 1961. Susie's ears had an unusual fold
              in their middle, making her resemble an owl. When Susie had kittens, two of them were
              born with folded ears, and one was acquired by William Ross, a neighbouring farmer and
              cat-fancier.

              born with folded ears, and one was acquired by William Ross, a neighbouring farmer and
              cat-fancier. Ross registered the breed with the Governing Council of the Cat Fancy
              (GCCF) in the United Kingdom in 1966 and started to breed Scottish Fold kittens with
              the help of geneticist Pat Turner. The breeding programme produced 76 kittens in the
              first three years - 42 with folded ears and 34 with straight ears. The conclusion from
              this was that the ear mutation is due to a simple dominant gene.
              <br />
              Susie's only reproducing offspring was a female Fold named Snooks who was also white;
              a second kitten was neutered shortly after birth. Three months after Snooks' birth,
              Susie was killed by a car. All Scottish Fold cats share a common ancestry to Susie.

            <p>
              The breed was not accepted for showing in Europe and the GCCF withdrew registrations
              in 1971 due to crippling deformity of the limbs and tail in some cats and concerns
              about genetic difficulties and ear problems such as infection, mites, and deafness.

              about genetic difficulties and ear problems such as infection, mites, and deafness,
              but the Folds were exported to America and the breed continued to be established using
              crosses with British Shorthairs and American Shorthairs. Since the initial concerns
              were brought, the Fold breed has not had the mite and infection problems, though wax
              buildup in the ears may be greater than in other cats. The concerns about deformities
              may have been caused by osteochondrodysplasia, which causes abnormalities in bone and
              cartilage throughout the body.

            <h2>Ears</h2>
            <p>
              Scottish Fold kittens that do not develop folded ears are known as Scottish Straights.
              The original cats had only one fold in their ears, but due to selective breeding,
              breeders have increased the fold to a double or triple crease that causes the ear to
              lie totally flat against the head.

            <h2>Body</h2>
            <p>
              The Scottish Fold is a medium to large sized cat, which can come in any colour, even
              calico. Males typically weigh 4-6 kg (8.8-13.2 lb), and females weigh 2.7-4 kg
              (6.0-8.8 lb). The Fold's entire body structure, especially the head and face, is
              generally rounded, and the eyes large and round. The nose is short with a gentle
              curve, and the cat's body is well-rounded with a padded look and medium-to-short legs.
              The head is domed at the top, and the neck very short. The broadly-spaced eyes give
              the Scottish Fold a "sweet expression". The Scottish Fold's ears are folded hence the
              name "Scottish Fold".

              Scottish Folds can be either long- or short-haired, and they may have nearly any coat
              colour or combination of colours (including white). Shorthair Scottish Folds have
              thick and soft fur, with longhair Folds having longer and exceptionally dense fur
              around their upper thighs, toes, ears, and tail.

              Scottish Folds, whether with folded ears or with normal ears, are typically
              good-natured and placid and adjust to other animals within a household extremely well.
              They tend to become very attached to their human caregivers and are by nature quite
              affectionate. Folds also receive high marks for playfulness, grooming and
              intelligence. Scottish Folds like to be outdoors and enjoy outdoor games and
              activities. Loneliness is something they heavily dislike.

              Folds are also known for sleeping on their backs. Scottish Folds typically have soft
              voices and display a complex repertoire of meows and purrs not found in better-known
              breeds. Folds are also known for sitting with their legs stretched out and their paws
              on their belly. This position is called the "Buddha Position".
